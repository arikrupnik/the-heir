# The Heir Brainstorm

Thinking of renaming the biker character to Cindy the Custodian.
She stores broken motorcycles and broken relationship as if in a museum of her former self.

Fullfillment of action request. My recollection of Rane's thoughts on Howard's clothing progression:

At the start of the film Howard is dressed in dark clothing he is closed off, in hiding and insists that this is not where he wants to be. 

At the next stage of the story his color scheme lightens as he discovers himself and who he wants to be.
Going to the picnic he dons a short sleeve button down of his father's or grandfather's and the "traditional" khakis as a symbol of accepting responsibility and moving forward with his life.

In the final scene, Howard returs to his lighter colored clothes that are his style. He is not continuing in the same way his forefathers have. He is a fuller version of himself, accepts and welcomes the future he has elected for himself.

Hannah's musical theme derives from Korobeiniki.
Hanna is very good at tetrissing her possessions into her storage unit.

Frank works for a private patrol company that has a controtract with the storage yard.
His job gives us an excuse to bring him into the yard.
He is a "toy cop."

Men in the Blank family seem to follow a pattern of shotgun marriages.
They carelessly get their girlfriends pregnant and then have to give up their hopes and dreams to support their families.
James wanted to ride motorcycles cross-country, William wanted to write, etc.
Howard discovers this pattern--something he's known subconsciously all his life--while digging through the unit.
He discovers another pattern that he had never reflected on.
All these men stayed with their families, and some had multiple children with their wives.
They had opportunities to pursue their dreams even after marriage.
James could take a week off for a motorcycle trip; he could take one off every year, but never did.
Is it possible these men actually wanted the lives they had?
Is it possible they had to trick themselves into pregnancies and marriages?
Is it possible James liked to complain about his lost freedom, but in reality preferred weekends with his family to the solitude of open road?
Howard thinks family is an awful thing that dumps responsibility on you, but what if the family is what he wants, like his father before him?

Penny has concerns about commitment and closing off opportunities.
She worries that settling down would take away her career prospects and social circle.
The Blank men apparently had the same concerns, and had to maneuver their circumstances to force their hands.

Men in the Blank family feel victimized and constrained by the women in their lives.
Men's life expectancy is also apparently much lower than women's in this family.

Howard's father, James Blank (1965-2000) loved to ride MOTORCYCLES; his wife put an end to that.

Howard's grandfather, William Blank (1944-2003) wanted to write.
Howard finds his old Selectric TYPEWRITER and 1,200 pages of MANUSCRIPT.
The typewriter is a gem.
The novel is garbage.
But it's also an heirloom.
It's one of the hardest things to discard, yet one that has only guilt value.
Ultimately, Howard burns the manuscript and scatters the ashes at the same place where the family had scattered the grandfather's ashes.

Howard's great-grandfather, Joseph Blank (1924-1944) died in WWII.
Family Legend has him dying at Omaha Beach, but there's some uncertainty about the veracity of this story.
He got his girlfriend Willabeth (1925-2010) pregnant just before he went off to war.
Willabeth raised William as a single mother.
She never married, what with the shortage of men after WWII.
She had active CORRESPONDENCE with a number of prison inmates over the years, but the relationships always withered when they got out and she met them in real life.

Howard's mother Moira (1966-2018) had fantasies about men rescuing her.
Real-life men always fell short of that ideal, including James and Howard.
Howard finds shelves and shelves of Moira's ROMANCE NOVELS.
The cover models are a tough act to follow.

Standards of beauty are hard to follow.
So are standards of morality.
The Blanks all take shortcuts here and there, especially where it hurts no one.
Howard finds a stack of VHS TAPES with bootleg movies on them.
"This is how we used to torrent movies back in the day," he tells Penny.
The only tape that is an official release is Howard the Duck.
Moira liked HTD so much, she named her son after him.
There is even a LASERDISC of HTD, though the Blanks never owned a LaserDisc player.
Moira's friends got a her the disk as a birthday present one year "for when they are rich enough to own one."

Refinement for Howard & Penny storyline:

* Initial attraction: Howard plays victim, Penny plays rescuer.
* By midpoint, Howard has stepped out of the drama triangle, and the relationship threatens to fall apart.
* Howard comes up with a different basis for the relationship, one that allows them to be equals.
* Howard teaches Penny how to ride a motorcycle, using his father's bike from the unit.
* Howard and Penny ride off into the sunset on a pair of adventure bikes.
  
Howard's backstory with Frank:

* Frank had (has?) alcohol issues.
* Frank used to dominate when sober; the roles would switch when Frank was drunk or hung over.
* Frank came into Howard's life in early adolescence. After Howard's father dies, Howard was the man of the house, but Frank took that away from him.

Howard's father rode motorcycles when he met Howard's mother, and it was part of the attraction. As the relationship developed, the mother wanted to domesticate and tame him, and he gave up riding. The father died in a car accident that may have been a suicide.

Cast additions: Rane Jameson is Howard the Heir.
Christopher Hagen is Manny the Manager.
Patrick Heraghty is Frank the step-Father.

What happens to Howard and Penny after the movie ends?
In a way this "forward-story" is as important as the backstory that we construct for characters.

Action items:

* Victoria and Rane are each writing a couple of paragraphs about where the characters want to be two years after the movie.

## 2018-06-10 Everyone in Dallas

We watched *Once Upon A Time In America* together.
A couple of things stood out:

* How much of the story is happening in music in pantomime: there are entire 5-minute sequences that drive the story forward without any dialogue at all.
* The ambiguity over whose story it is: De Niro gets top billing, but it may well be the story of James Woods' Max as told through the eyes of De Niro's Noodles.

Casting Howard remains a priority.
We are meeting with two out-of-town actors next week.
Thank you Patrick and Cordelia for recommending additional candidates--I'm looking forward to speaking with them.

We are going to visit the filming location on Monday.
We're meeting at 1908 FM 1187 in Crowley, TX 76036 at 10 am.

As part of our marketing effort, we're recording interviews with cast members where they describe our process and their experience with it.
The goal is to put up a series of short YouTube videos that can explain what we do--and garner interest in the project.

We discussed the possibility of changing the story if we cannot cast Howard.
One idea is to make the film more of an ensemble piece, focusing on how different characters deal with their hoards.
The hoarding aspects resonates with many of the people who read the treatment.
For some characters, this means expanding their roles.
For others--like Frank and Penny--it means refocusing them entirely.

Penny's big problem is guilt.
Starting with her hypochondriac mother and ending with the polar ice caps, everyone's problems are more important than Penny's.
Penny never wants to resolve conflicts of interest.
If she has no interests, they can never conflict with anyone else's.

The piano belongs to her mother, who fantasizes about the glory days of *her* mother's fancy parties.
In the meantime, she neglects to pay rent on the storage unit, and it's Penny's job to put things right with Manny.
At regular intervals, Penny must rescue the piano from repossession.
Rescuing the piano and trying to move it for her mother is what brings Penny to the storage yard in the first place.

Penny's arc is to acknowledge the conflict--and eventually to resolve it.
Penny has a choice about whose problems are more important.
The visible manifestation of this growth is her decision to stop rescuing the piano.

Some of the objects Howard may find that evoke his conflict with the family, and force him to reevaluate what he knows:

**Pill bottles.** The bottles now hold beads or dollhouse parts.
The sheer number of bottles and their labels force Howard to confront facts that he always knew but refused to assemble into an inevitable conclusion.
Official family story is frugality and reuse.
The story Howard must face is prescription substance abuse.

**Fishing gear.** Barely used, some still in store packaging.
Official family story is Howard's fishing weekends with his father (or step-father?).
The story Howard must confront is co-dependency with Frank's drinking.
How did he feel about cleaning up Frank's mess?
How old was he when he had his first drink at the lake?

**Shoeboxes with stripper heels in Moira's size.** Did Moira have her own fun while Frank and Howard were out "fishing?"
Maybe Frank and Moira had an understanding about partying with other people on weekends.
Or maybe they didn't.
Howard must decide how he deals with his parents' morals.

## 2018-05-07 Victoria + Ari

Penny starts out as a rescuer.
This may explain her act-one attraction to Howard.
Everyone in the world has problems that Penny wants to solve.
She even wants to solve global problems.
The only one in the world without problems is Penny.

So what *are* Penny's problems?
We need to know what her problems are, so she can resolve them.

She is afraid of commitment.
We don't know what is scary to her about commitment.

Penny's arc culminates in her stepping out of her rescuing game, similar to how Howard steps out of his victim game.


## 2018-05-02 Mary Lou + Ari

Anna is totally inappropriate.
Half the time, it's hard to tell if she's oblivious or passive-aggressive.
She might walk in on Manny's hydroponic operation, complimenting him on the quality of his plants--and then start taking photos of them.
When Manny protests, she might explain her intrusion as admiration,
"I'm going to show these at the garden show!"

After Anna burns her baggage and loses her memory, she is indenial about it.
Trying to get other people to tell her who she is, she scolds other characters with gusto:
"I bet you don't even know my name!"
