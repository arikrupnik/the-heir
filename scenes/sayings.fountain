INT. TOM'S UNIT - DAY

Tom is shuffling through tin plaques:

FRIENDS ARE THE FAMILY YOU CHOOSE

FORGIVENESS IS GIVING UP ON HAVING A BETTER PAST

IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO MAKE HAPPY CHILDHOOD MEMORIES EVEN IF THE CHILDHOOD IS NOT YOUR OWN

CLAIRE
What do they mean?

TOM
Mom always said these things.
She'd repeat them, but they never made any sense.

CLAIRE
Did she have them hanging in the house?

TOM
No. They must be grandma's.
