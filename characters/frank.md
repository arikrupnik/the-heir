**Frank** the step-father, 59: Howard's father figure.
Peaked as a college quarterback who never went pro.
Works for a private security patrol company as a "toy cop."
Speaks for the family's way of doing things.
Men in Howard's family feel that family robbed them of their freedom and potential.
Each had a dream--writing a great American novel, riding cross-country on a motorcycle, joining the NYPD.
Each had to sacrifice the dream to raise a family.
Frank is here to caution Howard against repeating this mistake.
