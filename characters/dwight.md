**Dwight** the deadbeat, makes his problems other people's problems.
Dwight thinks he can defer decisions and rent indefinitely.
Dwight pays up only when Manny double-locks his unit and threatens to auction it off.
He does this over and over, refusing to deal with his baggage but also refusing to clear it out.
Perhaps deep inside, Dwight would rather Manny auction his stuff: then it would become someone else's problem.
