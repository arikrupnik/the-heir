>**_GENERAL NOTES:_**<

.This is a first pass. it has not been thoroughly proofread for typos and spelling errors. It has been formatted in fountain IO, using slugline for integrated upload to github and other software programs, as needed.

.These are my general first thoughts on the story and characters, based on our improvs and conversations. I have tried to follow the same plot structure and outline that was previously built, adding in the credit sequence gags we had spoken about.

Enjoy,

.over black

The sound of a KEY IN A PADLOCK.

TITLE CARD: _the Heir_

Int. A dark place. Day.

The SCREECH OF METAL as a bar of light breaks the darkness at the bottom of the screen. Another SCREECH as the light grows upwards, burning away the title. One last SCREECH reveals the silhouette of a man. Behind him, a row of 10'x10' blue metal rolling doors. His hand reaches for the light switch.

REVEAL: HOWARD (29), his dark clothes look out of place in this sun-soaked, humid space. He stares forward in defeat.

HOWARD
Fuck me.

With a heavy sigh, he steps into the unit--

Boxes, bags, a myriad of old clothing and furniture engorge the tiny space. Howard reluctantly digs through the contents, unearthing a half-empty tube of toothpaste.

CUT TO:

Ext. Dumpster. Day.

Howard drudges forward with a large cardboard box. Arriving at a dumpster, he heaves the contents up and over. His eyes catch something as he pauses to study his find.

A PLUSH TOY CAT.

He tenderly lifts it out as childhood memories flow back to him. After a quiet beat, he looks up to see a SMALL CHILD.

HOWARD
Hi...
(silence)
What's your name, little guy?

Still nothing. The child is fixated on the plush cat. He reaches forward with his chubby little arms.

HOWARD
Oh... You want this?
(more silence)
His name is Mr. Whiskers. Not that you care.

Across the way the Mexican stand-off is being silently observed by PENNY (26), a bubbly young woman with kind eyes and a messy ponytail. She eagerly awaits the outcome.

HOWARD
Probably better off with you. Here.

Howard gifts the toy. The child greedily accepts.

MOTHER'S VOICE (O.S.)
Baby, where are you? We gotta go!

The child scampers off. Howard watches him disappear with a smile. His phone buzzes in his pocket. He checks the caller ID, silencing it and heading back towards his unit. Penny watches with intrigue, peeling off in the opposite direction.

CUT TO:

Int. Howard's unit. Day.

Howard holds up a hideous floral print dress. His mother's. A curious sniff test twists his nose.

BEN (O.S.)
It's the humidity down here.

Howard turns to find a sleazy looking man with wiry gray hair hair and a slick smile.

BEN
Name's Ben, champ. You?

HOWARD
Howard. Hi.

BEN
Howard! Good name. Like the great Howard Hughes.

HOWARD
Ugh, yeah--

BEN
Lemme tell you something Howie, I know what you're going through. Lemme guess, family's old unit?

HOWARD
Yeah.

Ben gives a knowing nod, intruding into the unit.

BEN
Yeah, in the end somebody always draws the short straw.

Ben sizes up the unit, assessing it's value.

BEN
Quite the pain in the ass to sort through it all. I could help you out, you know.

HOWARD
Oh yeah? How's so?

BEN
Well, you see I'm in the business of solving problems for people. You have a problem- *All This.* I offer a simple and easy solution. 

HOWARD
What? You wanna buy it?

BEN
I mean it's a lot more than that. I provide a service. Peace of mind. I deal with the heavy lifting so you don't have to. Trust me kid, you even know how much work it is to start digging into all *this.* It ain't worth it.

Howard's attention is drawn back into the unit.

HOWARD
I dunno, I mean... All this stuff... It belonged to my family.

BEN
Things get crammed away into these units for a reason, Howie.

He places his hand on Howard's shoulder, Howard eyes it. Ben eases up, playing the soft sell.   

BEN
Hey, no pressure. I just don't want to see you waste your time, kid.

He swiftly pulls a business card from his shirt pocket.

BEN
You change your mind, you know where to find me. Good luck.

Howard takes the card as Ben slips off.

HOWARD
(soto)
Thanks...

CUT TO:

Int. Howard's unit. Later.

Howard is up to his neck in the junk. Literally. His attention shifts as two people begin talking nearby.

MANNY (O.S.)
I don't care if your mom don't want to leave the house, she can still mail a god damn check! Or there's this wonderful thing called the internet. And credit cards.

PENNY (O.S.)
I know. I know, it's just--

The sound of a LOCK RATTLING AGAINST THE METAL DOOR.

Ext. Penny's unit. Same.

Penny digs out a crumpled wad of $1's from her purse as the storage facility manager, MANNY (56) watches impatiently.

PENNY
I promise, it won't happen again.

MANNY
I know it won't. Cause we're closing down come next month.

PENNY
Wait, what?

.back in howard's unit

This bit of knowledge peaks Howard's interest.

MANNY
We got bought out. Fucking *A1 Storage.* They're leveling the place to make way for some five story, fully automated mega-facility. They call it progress. I call it imperialism.

Leaning closer to the wall, Howard phone buzzes in his pocket. He quickly silences it--

.back to penny's unit.

PENNY
Well, what am I supposed to do with the piano?

MANNY
I don't give a rat's ass.

He snatches the wad of money, giving it a quick count.

MANNY
You're short.

PENNY
No, fifty-nine, like always.

MANNY
Plus last month. And late fees.

Penny digs out a few more crumpled bills from her purse.

PENNY
I... Things aren't that great at the diner... Can you, please?

MANNY
Who do I look like? Mother Teressa? 

He snatches the rest of her cash.

MANNY
We'll call it even, cause I'm in a good mood today.

He stuffs the cash in his pocket, unclipping a CROWDED RING OF KEYS from his belt. He bends down, removing a large RED LOCK from the door as he speaks--

MANNY
You got thirty days to figure it out. And I got news for you sweetie. The big guys? They ain't as forgiving.

Penny watches as he slinks off. She removes the second _SILVER LOCK_, hoisting up the metal door up with a SCREECH.

Int. Penny's unit. Day.

Penny walks into the unit towards a small vintage BABY GRAND PIANO, gently rubbing her hand along the edge.

PENNY
We meet again, old friend.

She admires it with a sad smile as Howard steps in--

HOWARD
Nice piano.

Penny turns, spotting Howard holding the ugly dress.

PENNY
Ahhh, if it isn't Saint Nick?

HOWARD
Huh?

PENNY
Nothing. I'm Penny.

HOWARD
Howard. Hi.
(re:piano)
You play?

PENNY
No it's my mother's-- Well grandmother's. Now mother's. Now, sort of mine, I guess. At least my responsibility, it seems.

HOWARD
That true about the thirty days?

PENNY
Manny's can be kind of a dick, but I don't think he's much of a liar. At least not in this case. You have a unit here?

HOWARD
Kinda--

Int. Howard's unit. Day.

Howard steps over followed by Penny. Her eyes go wide as she takes in the overflowing mess. Half of the unit blocked by a ragged old couch which is turned upright on its side.

PENNY
Wow! Quite the mess.

HOWARD
Yeah... Three generations of crap my family didn't want to deal with. Now I have to.

PENNY
Why do you have to?

HOWARD
Cause there's nobody else. My mom passed away a few weeks ago. My dad, years back.

PENNY
I'm sorry to hear.

HOWARD
No, it's fine. I'm fine.

PENNY
Brother's or sisters?

HOWARD
No. Just a stepfather I don't get along with.

PENNY
Yeah, I used to have one of those. Luckily my Mom was crazy enough to scare him off. Why don't you make him come deal with it?

HOWARD
Nothing to do with him. It was my Dad's side of the family. After he died, my Mom shoved all his stuff in here like he never even existed. To be honest, I forgot it existed. 

Penny gives her WATCH a quick check.

PENNY
I have to get to work soon, but... Want some help?

CUT TO:

Ext. Storage unit facility. Day.

Howard and Penny awkwardly haul a cumbersome old couch across the pavement in the hot sun, adjusting their grip as they go.

Ext. Dumpster. Day.

The pair plop down the couch down in front of the dumpster.

PENNY
Well, Howard. Nice to meet you--
(extending a handshake)
I've gotta go.

She bounces off, Howard quickly catches up to her.

HOWARD
Wait a minute, where you going?

PENNY
Work. Don't you listen?

HOWARD
Work. What do you do?

PENNY
I'm a waitress at a shitty little diner. It's *very* exciting. You?

HOWARD
I'm a coder-- A software engineer. I write computer programs.

PENNY
Sounds about as fun as waitressing.

HOWARD
Yeah, it's... work. To be honest, I kind of quit. Well, I mean-- I got fired. Lot of *stuff* going on in my life right now. Sort of snapped at my boss after my Mom's funeral. Broke his nose. So plenty of free time now to deal with, *all this.*

He stuffs his hands in his pockets, awkwardly shying his eyes away like a little boy. Penny takes pity on him.

PENNY
Well... Who knows? Maybe I'll see you around then?

HOWARD
Maybe.

One last smile and she bounces off. Howard's smitten. His phone buzzes in his pocket once again. He glances at the caller ID. He silences it.

CUT TO:

Ext. Storage unit. Dusk.

Day fades to night as Howard toils away, sorting the contents of his unit. More old clothes, shoes, and moth-eaten coats.

He shoves a pair of old sneakers into an overflowing box, hoisting it up to head back towards the dumpster--

Ext. Hannah's unit. Day.

Howard trods forward, his view obscured by the large box. Hannah the Hoarder (53) backs out of her unit just as Howard passes by. They crash into one another, Howard drops the box.

HANNAH
Ow!

HOWARD^
Sorry-- Sorry! I'm sorry. Are you okay?

Howard starts cleaning up the mess.

HANNAH
Oh I'm fine. Ain't made outta porcelain, darling. Here, let me--

Hannah begins to help, scooping up the HIDEOUS FLORAL DRESS.

HANNAH
Oh my God! Would you look at this?

HOWARD
Yeah, bunch of those in there.

HANNAH
Well this is just... *delightful!* What are you doing with all of these?

HOWARD
Uh-- I was gonna throw them out?

HANNAH
Oh no, you can't do that! Here, bring them inside, would you?

She motions for him to follow as she heads inside her unit.

.INISide hannah's unit

It's an impressive mess. A maze of disorganized knick-knacks and oddities. Everything from expired Pringles to ice skates.

HANNAH
Just set it down anywhere.

There's no space.

HOWARD
Uh, okay.

Howard attempts to find a spot amongst the clutter.

HOWARD
Quite the collection you have here.

HANNAH
Yeah, I never throw anything out. Everyone keeps telling me I need to, but then it never fails-- You throw something away, that's right when you end up needing it!

Hannah digs into the box as Howard eyes the unit, finding a stack of Starbucks cupholders taller than him. He lifts one--

HOWARD
You drink a lot of coffee?

She looks up, carefully taking the cupholder from him, placing it back on the top of the stack.

HANNAH
No.

Something about Howard catches her eye.

HANNAH
You look familiar. Are you-- Does your mother have a unit here?

HOWARD
Did, yes. She passed away.

HANNAH
Oh, I'm so sorry sweetie.

HOWARD
No, it's fine. I'm fine. Really.

HANNAH
You look just like her! What was her name? Mary? Maria?

HOWARD
Moira--

HANNAH
(cutting him off)
Moira! That's right.

Howard is itching to escape, but Hannah has him cornered.

HANNAH
I'm Hannah. And your name young man?

HOWARD
Howard.

HANNAH
Howard... Oh! I got just the thing for you. You wait right there.

She peels off.

HOWARD
No, I really have to--

He tries to break away, but she's gone. He politely lingers.

.deep inside hannah's unit

Hannah is in the depths of her kingdom, searching for something. She yells out to Howard--

HANNAH
Never met a Howard before. Not a common name these days.

Her face lights up as she pulls an item out of the tightly packed wall of junk like a Jenga block.

.back at the door

Howard waits impatiently, Hannah reemerges with a devious smile, her hands hidden behind her back.

HANNAH
Close your eyes.

He does.

>CUT TO BLACK:

HANNAH (O.S.)
Now, open!

.howard's pov

The black of the screen blinks open. A copy of the cinematic gem *Howard the Duck* proudly shoved right in his face.

HOWARD
Oh... Yeah. This is, great. Thanks. I can't accept this, really, I--

He reluctantly takes the VHS.

HANNAH
Oh, nonsense. I'm sure have another copy in there. You take it, Howard the Duck. That's what I'm gonna call you. Howard the Duck.
(an idea)
You like ducks? I have plenty of duck things in here-- I got rubber ducks, duck sweaters, duck socks...

Her rambling fades as she heads back into the unit. Howard seizes the opportunity to slip away before its too late.

Ext. Storage yard. Night.

Howard rounds the corner, turning back to check behind him. The coast is clear. As he strides forward, he slams right into ANNA THE AMNESIAC (57), a frail little old lady with a cane and a raspy voice.

ANNA
Ow! Hey, watch it!

HOWARD^
Sorry--Sorry!

She whacks him with her cane.

ANNA
You wanna play rough, I'm alright with that, you just let me know handsome.

She points the cane at his crotch. Howard tries to ignore the inappropriate comment, brushing aside the probing cane.

HOWARD
Uh, excuse me--

ANNA
Could you help me for a moment?

He's once again trapped by his politeness.

HOWARD
It's late, I really have to--

She's not listening.

ANNA
I can't seem to find my unit. Do you know which unit's mine?

HOWARD
No I don't, so if you'll excuse--

ANNA
I think it's this one. Would you?

She extends him a KEY, indicating the lock with her cane.

HOWARD
I, ugh... Sure.

Howard takes the KEY, bending over to try the lock. Anna positions herself behind him, admiring his butt.

ANNA
Yeah. Just like that. Stick it in there.

Howard pretends he didn't hear the implied comment, focusing on the lock. No luck.

HOWARD
It's not working. Are you sure this is your unit?

ANNA
Oh hell, I dunno. You get to be my age, you run out of gas in the old think tank. Start forgetting everything.

Howard hands her back the key.

HOWARD
Sounds kinda nice actually. No worries. Clean slate.

ANNA
A clean what?

HOWARD
Slate. A clean slate. Fresh start?

Anna stares blankly back at him. Then suddenly, she breaks away, catching her bearings.

ANNA
Is this my unit?

HOWARD
Excuse me?

ANNA
Could you help me for a moment? I can't seem to find my unit. Do you know which unit is mine?

Howard realizes they're looping back through the same conversation. He politely tries to weasel his way out of it--

HOWARD
I'm really, really sorry ma'am. But I have to go.

ANNA
Where we going?

HOWARD
*We?*

ANNA
Your place, or mine?

She suggestively shrugs her eyebrows. Howard's eyes go wide with terror. He knows there's no other option--

HOWARD
It was nice meeting you. Excuse me.

He quickly breaks away, like ripping off a bandaid. Anna watches him go with lust.

ANNA
Mmmm. I like it when they play hard to get.

She takes a big sexy bite like a great white shark.

CUT TO:

Ext. Howard's unit. Night.

Howard scurries around the corner, looking back over his shoulder. As he arrives at his unit, he's startled to find--

FRANK
Look who it is. The prodigal son

FRANK (50's) stands guard at the mouth of Howard's unit dressed in a private security uniform, hands on his hips.

FRANK  
Couldn't bother to visit while she was sick, sure came running to get your inheritance, didn't ya?

HOWARD
You come all the way out here to just to lecture me, as usual?

FRANK
Don't flatter yourself. Part of my patrol. Don't you have a job you should be at?

Howard says nothing.

FRANK
Let me guess? You quit?

HOWARD
Something like that.

FRANK
That was a good job you had, Howard! You can't just walk away from your responsibilities when things get tough.

HOWARD
Are you done? I didn't come back here to fight with you.

Frank looks around the unit, picking up an old guitar.

FRANK
So what're you gonna do? Keep all this junk? Trash it? I know what I'd do--

Howard grabs the guitar from Frank.

HOWARD
That's up to me to decide.

FRANK
That'd be a first.

Frank stares him down, then peels off to his patrol car.

FRANK
I'll tell you what-- Why don't you call me when decide to give up. I"ll come and take care of your problems, just like your mother always had to.

With that, he dips down inside, driving off.


Int. Howards unit. Night.

Exhausted by all the drama and crazy, Howard flops down onto a stack of old garbage bags with a deep sigh.

HOWARD
What have I gotten myself into?

He thinks for a beat, closing his eyes.

PAN UP TO:


Ext. Storage yard. Front entrance. Night.

Traffic whizzes by on the suburban highway as the stars shine down on this strange little world.


>_**END OF ACT I**_<

Int. Howard's unit. Morning.

Howard is squatted down, digging through a box of old VHS tapes, all of them bootlegged copies of older movies.

PENNY
Morning stranger!

Howard looks up to find a smiling Penny holding two coffee's.

PENNY
Figured you could use some fuel for the race.

He rises, gladly taking the coffee with a smile.

HOWARD
God yes! Thank you.

PENNY
How's it coming along?

HOWARD
Slowly. I'm just trying to figure out what's worth keeping, and what's pure junk.

PENNY
(re: VHS)
What's that?

HOWARD
A bootlegged copy of...
(reading the label)
*Snow White.*

PENNY
Oooh! My favorite.

Howard moves back to the box--

HOWARD
God, there's hundreds of these. They're all bootlegged.

Penny spots something unique amongst the crowd--

PENNY
Oh, except for--

She plucks a _legitimate_ copy of *Howard the Duck.*

PENNY
The pinnacle of cinematic achievement.

HOWARD
Yeah... We all make mistakes.

Something else catches Penny's eye. She reaches for the VHS copy of *Howard the Duck* that Hannah gave Howard.

PENNY
Some sort of a weird fetish I should know about?

HOWARD
That was a gift. From... Hannah?

PENNY
Ah, yes! You met Hannah. She's always here, adding more and more crap to that unit. Sad, really.

Howard continues to dig into the VHS box. Penny moves on to another box, this one filled with old DVDs. Half legitimate, half bootlegged.

PENNY
Looks like there was some lag time figuring out how to pirate DVDs.

Yet another oddity stops her short. She removes not just one, but *two* legitimate DVDs of *Howard the Duck.*

PENNY
Okay, now this is just weird. Why did your family own so many--

HOWARD
Okay, look-- People used to always buy me copies for my birthday, Christmas.

PENNY
Why, because--

Howard tries to avert his eyes as it dawns on her.

PENNY
Oh my god... Are you named after *Howard the Duck*?

HOWARD
I don't want to talk about it.

Howard snatches the DVDs from her, peeling away.



>_**ADDITIONAL EXAPLE SCENES**_<

**HANNAH #2 - Howard gets the 8MM PROJECTOR.**

ext. Hannah's unit. Day.

An upbeat Howard skips around the corner with a an 8MM FILM REEL in his hand. He slides up to Hannah's unit whistling the *Howard the Duck* theme song. A light *_KNOCK-KNOCK--_* 

Hannah looks up from polishing an ORNATE METAL CANISTER.

HANNAH
Hey! Howard the Duck! How you doing, sweetie?

She carefully sets the CANISTER aside.

HOWARD
Good, I'm good! But I need some help. Found a bunch of these old tapes, but nothing to play them. Figured you'd be the lady to talk to. 

He hands over the REELS to Hannah, who inspects them.

HOWARD
Got something to help me out?

A devious smile creeps over Hannah's face.

HANNAH
Do I...

She proudly peels off--

.inside hannah's unit

HANNAH
Eight millimeter, darling. "Reels", not *tapes.* You need yourself a projector!

Hannah eyes the wall of junk, searching for--

HANNAH
Ah! Here we are.

She uses a step-stool to reach up, sliding out a small box. She blows off some dust, heading back out to Howard.

.outside the unit

Hannah hands over the bounty-- A 1960's KODAK 8MM PROJECTOR.

HANNAH
Memories... They're not forever. But these are, if you take care of 'em...

Her face falls as Howard accepts the projector.

HANNAH
I used to have boxes and boxes of all our family's old film reels. Every birthday, graduation--

She gets lost in the warm memories. Then suddenly turns--

HANNAH
Until my daughters had the wise idea to digitize the whole lot of 'em for my birthday one year. Stuck it all on some tiny little hard drive thingy. Threw out the originals. And you know what happened? I lost the damn hard drive!

HOWARD
Oh, well I'm sure it's in here somewhere? But listen, I have to--

He reaches for the REELS, but Hannah has a death grip on them, reminiscing.

HOWARD
--get going, so... I'm gonna need--

He pulls harder, finally yanking them away and snapping Hannah back to reality.

HOWARD
*These!* Thank you, really. I'll return it as soon as I'm done.

HANNAH
Oh, no rush, darling. You have yourself a good time! I have three more in there. 

Of course she does. Howard breaks away, back to--


**HANNAH #3 - Howard returns PROJECTOR, discovers URNS.**

Ext. Hannah's unit. Night.

Howard approaches with the projector in hand. He *knocks--*

HOWARD
Hello?
(nothing)
Hellooo?

He dips his head inside the unit, no sign of Hannah. He enters, heading back roughly to where Hannah removed the projector. He finds the empty slot overhead, but no sign of the step-stool. Rising onto his tip-toes, he tries to slide n the missing piece into the puzzle of junk. *Almost... there...*

HANNAH (O.S.)
What're you doing in here!?!?

A startled Howard jumps backwards, bumping into a tall dresser and knocking over a cluster of ORNATE METAL CANISTERS. Howard catches one that falls off.

HANNAH
THAT'S MY HUSBAND!!!

Realizing just *what* it is, Howard handles it like a hot potato as Hannah angrily steps forward grabbing it from him.

HANNAH
Don't you have any respect for the dead? What're you doing in my unit?

HOWARD
I was-- just returning the projector, I didn't mean to--

HANNAH
You shouldn't be so carless! These aren't just _*things,*_ these are _people_! They demand respect.

Hannah pushes past him, carefully replacing her husband's canister, organizing the others.

HANNAH
There there, my love. It's okay. You're okay. Shhh...

She gently strokes the canister like a baby. Howard watches, creeped out by this morbid turn of events.

HOWARD
Hannah?
(silence)
I'm... gonna go.

Hannah continues murmuring softly to the urns. Howard uses the opportunity to quietly slip away.
