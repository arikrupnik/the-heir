**Drake** the antagonist, 59: Tom's step-father.
Drake may be absent physically in act I, but Tom's recollections introduce him from the start.
Has severe boundary issues.
Peaked as a college quarterback who never went pro.
Nothing happened in his life since, and is unlikely to happen ever again.
Drake is willing to accept only happy baggage and ignores the disappointments.
To fill his entire life with the little happy baggage he has, Drake exaggerates it.
One of his worries is that Tom might find evidence of this exaggeration in his storage unit.
